I play in a punk bank and my guitarist wants to write a song that is potentially in Drop C. This would ordinarily be fine, but all our other songs are in Drop D and some of the covers we play are in Standard (they could be transposed but for playability Standard is far easier).

A long ass time ago I made a post saying somebody should rank every A7X song ever written. People have done that with albums, but not songs. It was kind of a joke and I didn't expect anybody to do it, so I decided, "Fuck it, I'll do it."
