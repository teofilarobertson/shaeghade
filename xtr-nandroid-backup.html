I just need the profile to perform the same tasks, but I want my backups stored on an external SD card and the Retention profile to check the SD card instead of internal storage.

As long as you have TWRP installed on the Galaxy S8 or the Galaxy S8+, then you can follow these steps to create a full Nandroid backup Hi! I want to do a Nandroid backup of my phone, since I want to test a new rom and NanoDroid (Microg). Would restoring from a Nandroid backup overwrite whatever is installed? Is restoring with Nandroid basically What is Nandroid Backup - How to Backup and Restore ROM using TWRP Recovery! - Duration: 8:14. Gupta Information Systems 21,433 views. Does anyone know if its possible to do a nandroid backup of a LOS system directly to a pc without also creating a backup copy on the device? When I try to do this using twrp and adb it always creates a phone copy, which mostly defeats the point of this capability. amp#x200B; I've first tried asking this on r/AndroidQuestions at https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/ak3vrn/using\_twrp\_to\_backup\_to\_pc\_only/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/ak3vrn/using_twr. Taking a Nandroid backup with TWRP Recovery will come in handy when you accidentally mess-up your device. With a Nandroid Backup, you can get back your phone to a usable state in minutes. 
 Backups are quite important due to the role they play in preventing data loss. Nandroid backups are a backup option for persons with Android devices which are rooted. I am trying to create a Nandroid backup via ADB using TWRP 3.2.3-0. My phone (Moto G6) is currently rooted, bootloader unlocked, with TWRP as recovery. I verified that I have the current Google usb drivers installed for ADB Whenever I try to run the ADB command in the console ("adb backup --twrp"), the console will only display the help file for ADB. It doesn't prompt the TWRP interface to begin backup at all. It seems like ADB isn't recognizing the "backup" command. I have verified I’m recommending our readers to take a Nandroid backup before making major changes to their Android devices. In this post, we will see what is a Nandroid backup and the steps to make it using. 
I'd like to create a nandroid backup but TWRP isn't recognising my sdcard (decryption issue in this version of TWRP I think.). What can I do? I don't want to format everything as I've just spend ages setting it all up. Is there a way of downgrading TWRP without wiping data or system. Nandroid backup is a method of saving a copy of device’s NAND memory data using a special software and a root privileges for this particular device. Doing it requires some skills and carry a potential risk for any data stored on an Android device (including damaging My Nexus 6P A2 just arrived with 6.0.1 installed. I have always run stock Android and never touched modifications before. I've been reading Android Explained guides this week in anticipation of getting my device. I'll return to Australia later this year and take this device with me, so the option of fixing any problems with botched updates myself is very appealing to me. I am also keen for double-tap-to-wake, so I may root the device in the future. I want to: unlock the bootloader install. Please remember to add a category to the bottom of each page that you create. See categories help for further details, but most will probably be Category:HTC ModelName. My current device is a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge 32gb with TWRP, latest version of Magisk, and a custom SuperStock (https://forum.xda-developers.com/s7-edge/development/kernel-superstock-v1-3-5-t3453462) kernel. Recently the display broke after an accident and is barely functional, although it will work sporadically if I keep trying long enough. The phone itself is still otherwise functional and can boot and run normally. Recently I made a nandroid backup through TWRP (system, boot, data partit. when you're inside the clockworkmod recovery and go to backup and restore, youll see 'nandroid' written as the header at the top of the screen. nandroid backups are complete backups of the current state of your phone - saved onto your sd card which is safe from flashing custom roms - and you can use the restore part to either bring your phone back to a previously saved backup. Some details so that answers can be of a wide variety: Device: OnePlus One 64GB TWRP Version: 3.0.2.0 ROM and it's mods: Sultan's CM13 w/ Root and Xposed Framework What I want to do: Create a backup of my Data partition (I already have the boot, system and cache backups) The Issue: The data partition takes up around 40gb, so I can't create the backup on the phone itself. My Question: Can I create a backup of the Data partition which excludes certain folders Hi! As the title suggests, I've rooted my phone and streamlined it, thus getting to the point that warrants a backup. Ideally I'd like to image my phone so I can restore it if anything goes wrong. My problem is that Samsung phones are automatically encrypted in the set up process and can't seem to find a way round it. If I use TWRP to backup it can't read /data so I can't back it up in recovery. I have read about Online Nandroid Backup and tried it, but it seemed to just run a timer 
lineageos messes with phone date (in recovery), can I take online Nandroid backup? is there any solution. I have a Nexus 6P, and have been dealing with battery issues. I installed TWRP on my first 6P, made a nandroid backup, then transferred that backup to a computer. When I got a replacement 6P I again installed TWRP, transferred the nandroid backup to the replacement, and tried to restore the backup. TWRP worked for 10+ minutes, then told me it was done and it had restored the backup. I rebooted, but the phone booted into recovery. I tried restoring the backup again with the same results. I am currently in the process of getting a new Nexus One because of a power button issue. I was wondering if this order of operations would work: Nandroid backup my old Rooted, Unlocked, MIUI ROM'd N1 to the uSD card using clockwork recovery Move the uSD card into the new, Unrooted, locked, stock N1 fastboot unlock, and manually install clockwork recovery using fastboot Restore the Nandroid backup to the new phone with clockwork. Profit? I dont think I have ever read about someone. I have TWRP on my current Nexus 6P. I'm planning on doing a nandroid backup and restoring that on my Pixel XL. Does anyone have steps to make sure the transition will be seamless? Do I only need to backup the /data/ partition? I know security should be removed before performing the backup, are there any other things I made a backup of my 5x when it was running rooted/xposed 6.0.1 but then decided to update to 7.1.1 to try out the new features. But now I really miss a lot of xposed modules so I decided that I want to restore my 6.0.1 backup that I made a couple of weeks ago. So I flashed the 6.0.1 factory image from Google's developer website and was able to successfully boot into Marshmallow again. However after installing TWRP I tried restoring the backup (through USB OTG) after wiping system and cache. Is there anyone out there who would be willing to make a full Nandroid Backup for all of us who haven't gotten the update. Hello I'm using axon7 (A2017U) and I keep getting this error "unable to locate partition by backup name: 'boot' any info is appreciated thanx. How do I know which version to download and install from here: download.purefusionos.com/roms/pme ? -If want the latest stable release, should I go and download the latest uploaded zip under /release-o or should I take it from /testing-o? -One other thing. I come from rooted (magisk with xposed) Sense stock. If I do a nandroid backup of my whole system and decide to restore it if I'm not happy with Pure Fusion ROM. Will I then get back exactly to where I am today, with all my magisk module. 
All tutorials online just tell me to "check whatever partitions I want". But what if don’t know what I want? Boot, System and Data are selected by default. Is that all it takes? There’s a 3GB System Image partition, being so large, do I need to back it up too? Basically what I am looking for is take a “snapshot” of my cellphone and being able to restore it to the way it was when needed. What does everyone choose when doing a Nandroid Backup. So if I move to a custom ROM and lose magisk's safetynet in the process, will the safety net be restored if I restore to the nandroid backup that I've already taken? I'm currently rooted with magisk on stock. So i have an HTC One m8 from t-mobile that is using clockworkmod recovery along with cyanogenmod 12. My CID is T-MOB010, and I don't know my version-main number, but i was told that since my hboot version is 3.19, I can use any 3.XX or 2.22 backup. I can't seem to find these firmwares anywhere. I did find one but "TWRP" was in the file name, and it didn't work when I tried using it with clockwork (md5 issues), so im assuming I need TWRP to use it. Problem there is that I can't flash TWRP right. 
I've read this https://www.reddit.com/r/xposed/comments/4tqss1/helpstuck_in_a_boot_loop_after_flashing_xposed/ Any thoughts? Thanks. I found this info on another forum a few days ago. Thought it would be helpful to others on here so I decided to export and share. Due to everyone's needs and device being different, I'm not going to upload the xml file since some editing on your part might have to be done. I currently have mine setup to run twice a month on the 1st and 15th. You can change the dates to better suit your individual needs. You will need to be Rooted with TWRP flashed. I'm not sure if a similar process could. </p>
