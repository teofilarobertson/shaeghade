                            <p>Hello, I am running Manjaro latest and greatest. Suddenly LightDM has stopped working. I have tried all I knew to try to no avail and am now reaching out for help. Below, my lightDM and Xorg log is attached: lightdm.log +0.01s DEBUG: Logging to /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log +0.01s DEBUG: Starting Light Display Manager 1.28.0, UID=0 PID=590 +0.01s DEBUG: Loading configurat. Question, how can a get xvesa working? The latest snapshot change to using spleen console font looks terrible. Capitalised x, j, i, t etc just don't look right. The change also requires modification to tput console menus as the font is larger. I have a onboard radeon/ati board that I use for graphics, so as a fix I thought I'd switch that over to just using xvesa. I boot to the boot prompt, and enter boot -c to enter the boot configuration menu and enter the command disable. For Christmas I was gifted a Radeon 560 to replace my Nvidia 8800 GT, and now I can't play rocket league. With the 8800 I could play RL on low settings (as well as CS:GO and Fallout NV to name some other games) without any issue. Now with the 560, RL loads faster, I can play on high settings, but I can't load into games (CS:GO and Fallout NV still run and look great now). Most of the time I get error 58, but I've also gotten error 42 (I've also gotten a bunch of seemingly random. ### Singularity system requirements (minimum) CPU: Intel(R) Pentium(R) D (dual core) 2.8GHz or AMD Athlon(TM) X2 4800+ or better RAM: 1 GB (2 GB for Windows Vista or Windows 7) OS: Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP / Windows Vista(R) / Windows(R) 7 VIDEO CARD: 3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectX(R) 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers \ NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) 8800 GT 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding GeForce(R) 9400) / ATI Radeon(TM) X1800 256 MB RAM and better.

I have been a member of the PCMR since I was about 12, although I was merely a lurker on this reddit, as I was basically a pleb with my old system. I've only had 2 rigs and a decent little laptop since I started. The first rig was a custom-built hand-me-down, with a pentium 4 CPU, 8x VGA gfx card, and 1 gb of ram. It ran everything very well at the time. The second was a Lenovo Core 2 Quad(Q6600) system, which started with 32bit OS, 3gb of ram, and a Geforce 8800 GTS. As of right. 
Alright, here is the thing. I used PvP Watchdog from when it was first released and i didn't have any troubles with it. Some frame dips here and there with the overlay active but nothing major. Now my game crashes at random when using PvP Watchdog latest version. I have tested this multiple times, it has something to do with how the hooks work. Without WD, my game works fine but the name crash bug happens every now and then. With WD i get random crashes without any explanation. Warping Hello everyone. I'm posting this partially to get help and partially to document what I've done in troubleshooting this so far. So I recently put together a new PC with the following components: Motherboard ( - Processor ( - 2x RAM Chips ( - Case (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E1. Samsung ATIV Book 8 Model NP880Z5E-X01UB 3rd Gen i7-3635QM 16GB memory 500GB SSD AMD Radeon HD 8770M &Drivers: Default Samsung graphics drivers are pretty ass (13.x so I run 14.4). Also using this: --- Issue: So my friend bought me a 6950 (MSI Twin Frozr iii 1GB Power Edition) for Christmas and we encountered some minor issues that did not have any apparent solutions in a google search, 120Hz monitors and flashing to a 6970. So I have a 120Hz monitor and when we plugged it in, i noticed that the desktop was not as smooth as it should be. We look in the Catalyst drivers and the monitor's refresh rate was locked at 60Hz. That caused me some worry, looking for drivers for the monitor and checking Catal. I'm building a new system for Christmas and trying to decide between these 2 cards: Geforce 560ti ( Radeon 6950 ( The 6950 has 2GB so it's more future proof. I've read there's not too much advantage to 2GB at the moment. I also know there's a 1GB available for about the same price as the 560ti but if I'm going the 6950 I'd rather spend the extra Welcome to the subreddit FAQ. If this FAQ does not answer your question, please make your own post. What is Chivalry:Medeival Warfare and Deadliest Warrior? - Medieval warfare (Often called MW) was the first game by Torn Banner Studios, and is a multiplayer focused action first person slasher. Deadliest Warrior (DW) is the official expansion, meaning you need to own MW to buy DW. DW is a separate game but has similarities to MW. This subreddit pertains to both games, but we tend to focus.

I want to purchase a new gaming PC. I really want something that can utilize duel monitors so I can play both EVE along with WoW or something along those lines. im not to good with specs and stuff so I figured id ask you smart persons :) Minimum Requirements For WoW: Operating System Windows® XP / Windows Vista® with the latest service pack Processor Intel® Core™ 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom™ X3 8750 Video NVIDIA® GeForce® 8800 GT, ATI Radeon™ HD 4850, or Intel® HD Graphics 3000 Memory So, I like having lots of monitors, but I also like to game occasionally. Problem is, most gaming oriented GPUs tend to have 4 outputs at most. I know MST hubs are a thing, and I've been reading (https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-4.1-Radeon-DP-MST) MST support was added in the 4.1 kernel. I'm curious, has anyone here had any experience getting this to work? a bit of background/rationale: I'm currently running 5 monitors off a HD7750 (6 mini-DP), but its dated. My husband (for whom I'm writing this up, he cleverly stays away from reddit and other social media platforms) and I have the same PCs, two HP Envy Phoenixs. Beside peripherals, everything about them is the same. Different headset, different gaming mouse, different monitor. Beside that, same system, same age. These are the stats of said PCs: > OS: Windows 8 64 (both updated to 8.1) > CPU: Intel® Core™ i5-4670K (3,4 GHz, 6 MB Cache, 4 Cores) > Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce. ------------------ System Information ------------------ Time of this report: 3/5/2016, 21:57:11 Machine name: LUKE-PC Operating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_gdr.160121-1718) Language: English (Regional Setting: English) System Manufacturer: System manufacturer System Model: System Product Name BIOS: BIOS Date: 03/23/12 17:14:31 Ver: 11.03 Processor: AMD FX(tm)-4170 Quad-Core Processor. I was working on my system, replacing a failed power supply, and I left my HD 7950 on the carpet. It managed to get submerged under water when a pipe in the house burst. Insurance is reimbursing me 0 for the card. The card is leftover from a moderately profitable litecoin mining setup, which I sold months ago (except for this card). I haven't kept up with nVidia at all (last card was an 8800 GT). AMD has nothing in the 0 range for sale, other than whatever stock of the HD7950 is left!!. Hello folks, let me apologize in advance if I come off at all newbie or that I don't know what I'm doing (because I kinda don't). I have with me an old DELL XPS 420, and while I'd love to make a full custom PC eventually, I have to make due with this until at least this year. The problem is the graphics card (NVIDIA Geforce 8800 GT) is basically dying. I use to be able to play Bethesda games and Skype without much issue, but this is no longer the case. I can't even download the drivers 
So i recently Got a new CPU, MOBO, and GPU, and I have some questions about the drivers. So previously i have an Nvidia 8800, and i need to know how i can delete my previous drivers, install my Radeon Drivers, and i need to know if i have to update CPU drivers. So i could really I've been a big fan of the CoH series but I need to be sure if I need to upgrade my pcor not. I used systemrequirementslab.com do determine if my pc could run CoH2. These were the results: CPU Minimum: 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or Equivalent You Have: Intel(R) Pentium(R) Dual CPU E2180 @ 2.00GHz Click here for the latest CPU drivers. Upgrade Suggested CPU Speed Minimum: 2 GHz You Have: 2.0 GHz Performance Rated at: 3 GHz RAM Minimum: 2 GB You Have: 2.1 GB OS Minimum: Windows Vista (32bit. So my gpu is dead (Radeon HD 7870). My computer crashed one night while I was playing a game and it will not get past the windows login screen. Artifacts all over the screen and the computer is frozen. Tried reseating it, did clean uninstall of drivers and nothing worked. Got on safe-mode, uninstalled the drivers and restarted, it works until windows automatically reinstalls drivers and computer just freezes/crash again. I went and accepted that the card is dead, and I took out an older 
Looking for a mid-range graphics card for my Dell Inspiron 531. Based on the purchase date (late-2007), I'm pretty sure the MB (Asus M2N61-AX) only has PCIe version 1.x (x16 slot), while the cards now available are version 2.0. So, my main question is whether this affects what I should be looking for and if PCIe 2.0 cards will be compatible in practice. Card suggestions would also be welcome.
